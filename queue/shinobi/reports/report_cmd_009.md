# OGame (Browser Game) Research

## 1. What is OGame

*   **Game Overview**: OGame is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) real-time strategy game set in a science fiction universe. Players are given a single, undeveloped planet and must build it into a powerful empire through resource management, technological research, and strategic warfare. The ultimate goal is to accumulate points and rank among the top players in the universe. Alliances between players are a key feature for cooperative strategy and defense.
*   **Genre**: Real-Time Strategy (RTS), Space Simulation MMO.
*   **Operating Company**: The game was developed and is operated by **Gameforge**, a German video game publisher.

## 2. Game Systems

The core gameplay revolves around a cycle of developing planets, building fleets, and interacting with other players.

*   **Resources**: The game's economy is based on four primary resources:
    *   **Metal**: The main resource for constructing buildings, ships, and defenses.
    *   **Crystal**: Used for technological research and constructing more advanced units and buildings.
    *   **Deuterium**: A valuable resource used as fuel for fleets and to power certain advanced buildings.
    *   **Energy**: Required to power mines and other facilities. It is generated by solar plants, fusion reactors, and solar satellites.

*   **Buildings**: Players construct and upgrade various buildings on their planets to produce resources, research technology, and build military units. Key buildings include Mines (for Metal, Crystal, Deuterium), Power Plants (for Energy), a Robotics Factory (to speed up construction), and a Shipyard (to build fleets).

*   **Fleets**: Fleets are the backbone of military and economic expansion. They consist of various ship types, each with unique stats and roles (e.g., Cargo Ships for transport, Cruisers for combat, Recyclers for harvesting debris, Espionage Probes for spying). Fleets can be sent on various missions:
    *   **Attack**: To raid another player's planet for resources.
    *   **Transport**: To move resources between a player's own planets.
    *   **Deploy**: To move a fleet to another planet or moon for strategic positioning.
    *   **Espionage**: To gather intelligence on an opponent's resources and defenses.
    *   **Harvest**: To collect resources from debris fields left after battles.

*   **Combat System**: Combat is not directly controlled by the player. When a fleet on an "Attack" mission reaches a target, the battle is automatically calculated by the server. The outcome is determined by the stats of the ships and defensive structures involved (Weaponry, Shields, Hull). The result is delivered to the players in a detailed combat report, and a percentage of the destroyed ships' resources forms a debris field that can be harvested.

## 3. Why Automation is Needed

The game's 24/7, real-time nature creates a significant need for automation to remain competitive and protect assets.

*   **Constant Threat**: Since the game world is persistent, a player's empire is vulnerable to attack at any time, day or night. This makes it nearly impossible to defend assets while offline (e.g., sleeping or working).
*   **Fleet Saving**: This is the most critical reason for automation. An unattended fleet at a planet is an easy target. A single successful attack can destroy a fleet that took months to build. "Fleet saving" is the practice of sending one's fleet on a mission (like Transport or Deploy) so it is in transit and invulnerable when an attack is predicted to land. Bots excel at this by automatically detecting an incoming attack and dispatching the fleet to safety, a task that is impossible to perform manually 24/7.
*   **Repetitive Tasks**: High-level gameplay involves many repetitive, time-consuming actions, such as:
    *   **Farming**: Constantly raiding inactive players to plunder their resources.
    *   **Probing**: Sending espionage probes to thousands of planets to find suitable targets.
    *   **Resource Management**: Transporting resources between a player's multiple planets to fuel development.
    Bots can execute these tasks around the clock with perfect efficiency, far beyond human capability.

## 4. Official Terms of Service

Gameforge's official stance is unequivocal: **the use of bots and any form of automation is strictly forbidden.**

*   **§1 Accounts**: The rules state that an account must be played only by a single person.
*   **§3 Bashing**: This rule, while about excessive attacks, is often related to bot activity that enables such behavior.
*   **§6 Bugusing & Scripting**: This is the most direct rule. It explicitly prohibits using any program that acts as an interface between the player and the game, including automation scripts. The only permitted way to play is via a conventional, unmodified web browser.

Violating these rules can and often does result in a temporary or permanent ban of the player's account.

## 5. Technical Characteristics

OGame is a classic example of a first-generation browser-based game, built on a simple client-server architecture.

*   **HTTP-Based Communication**: Every action a player takes—such as building a mine, sending a fleet, or viewing a different menu—is transmitted as a standard HTTP request (typically GET or POST) from the user's browser to the game server.
*   **Server-Side State**: The server processes the request, updates the game state in its database (e.g., starting a construction timer, calculating fleet arrival time), and sends back a new HTML page reflecting the updated state.
*   **No Real-Time Connection**: Unlike modern games that might use WebSockets for a continuous connection, OGame's model is turn-based and asynchronous. Actions take a set amount of time to complete on the server, and the client only needs to refresh the page to see the result.
*   **Vulnerability to Automation**: This simple, predictable HTTP-based structure makes it relatively easy for bots to operate. A bot does not need to "see" the game; it simply needs to be programmed to send the correct sequence of HTTP requests to the server to perform actions like checking for attacks, sending fleets, or raiding targets, thus mimicking a human player without a browser interface.
