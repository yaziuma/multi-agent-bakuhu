# Communication Protocol

## Mailbox System (inbox_write.sh)

Agent-to-agent communication uses file-based mailbox:

```bash
bash scripts/inbox_write.sh <target_agent> "<message>" <type> <from>
```

Examples:
```bash
# Shogun → Karo
bash scripts/inbox_write.sh karo "cmd_048を書いた。実行せよ。" cmd_new shogun

# Ashigaru → Karo
bash scripts/inbox_write.sh karo "足軽5号、任務完了。報告YAML確認されたし。" report_received ashigaru5

# Karo → Ashigaru
bash scripts/inbox_write.sh ashigaru3 "タスクYAMLを読んで作業開始せよ。" task_assigned karo
```

Delivery is handled by `inbox_watcher.sh` (infrastructure layer).
**Agents NEVER call tmux send-keys directly.**

## Delivery Mechanism

Two layers:
1. **Message persistence**: `inbox_write.sh` writes to `queue/inbox/{agent}.yaml` with flock. Guaranteed.
2. **Wake-up signal**: `inbox_watcher.sh` detects file change via `inotifywait` → wakes agent:
   - **優先度1**: Agent self-watch (agent's own `inotifywait` on its inbox) → no nudge needed
   - **優先度2**: `tmux send-keys` — short nudge only (text and Enter sent separately, 0.3s gap)

The nudge is minimal: `inboxN` (e.g. `inbox3` = 3 unread). That's it.
**Agent reads the inbox file itself.** Message content never travels through tmux — only a short wake-up signal.

Special cases (CLI commands sent via `tmux send-keys`):
- `type: clear_command` → sends `/clear` + Enter via send-keys
- `type: model_switch` → sends the /model command via send-keys

## Agent Self-Watch Phase Policy (cmd_107)

Phase migration is controlled by watcher flags:

- **Phase 1 (baseline)**: `process_unread_once` at startup + `inotifywait` event-driven loop + timeout fallback.
- **Phase 2 (normal nudge off)**: `disable_normal_nudge` behavior enabled (`ASW_DISABLE_NORMAL_NUDGE=1` or `ASW_PHASE>=2`).
- **Phase 3 (final escalation only)**: `FINAL_ESCALATION_ONLY=1` (or `ASW_PHASE>=3`) so normal `send-keys inboxN` is suppressed; escalation lane remains for recovery.

Read-cost controls:

- `summary-first` routing: unread_count fast-path before full inbox parsing.
- `no_idle_full_read`: timeout cycle with unread=0 must skip heavy read path.
- Metrics hooks are recorded: `unread_latency_sec`, `read_count`, `estimated_tokens`.

**Escalation** (when nudge is not processed):

| Elapsed | Action | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 0〜2 min | Standard pty nudge | Normal delivery |
| 2〜4 min | Escape×2 + nudge | Cursor position bug workaround |
| 4 min+ | `/clear` sent (max once per 5 min) | Force session reset + YAML re-read |

## Inbox Processing Protocol (karo/ashigaru)

When you receive `inboxN` (e.g. `inbox3`):
1. `Read queue/inbox/{your_id}.yaml`
2. Find all entries with `read: false`
3. Process each message according to its `type`
4. Update each processed entry: `read: true` (use Edit tool)
5. Resume normal workflow

### MANDATORY Post-Task Inbox Check

**After completing ANY task, BEFORE going idle:**
1. Read `queue/inbox/{your_id}.yaml`
2. If any entries have `read: false` → process them
3. Only then go idle

This is NOT optional. If you skip this and a redo message is waiting,
you will be stuck idle until the escalation sends `/clear` (~4 min).

## Redo Protocol

When Karo determines a task needs to be redone:

1. Karo writes new task YAML with new task_id (e.g., `subtask_097d` → `subtask_097d2`), adds `redo_of` field
2. Karo sends `clear_command` type inbox message (NOT `task_assigned`)
3. inbox_watcher delivers `/clear` to the agent → session reset
4. Agent recovers via Session Start procedure, reads new task YAML, starts fresh

Race condition is eliminated: `/clear` wipes old context. Agent re-reads YAML with new task_id.

## Report Flow (interrupt prevention)

| Direction | Method | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Ashigaru → Karo | Report YAML + inbox_write | File-based notification |
| Karo → Shogun/Lord | dashboard.md update only | **inbox to shogun FORBIDDEN** — prevents interrupting Lord's input |
| Top → Down | YAML + inbox_write | Standard wake-up |

## File Operation Rule

**Always Read before Write/Edit.** Claude Code rejects Write/Edit on unread files.

## Inbox Communication Rules

### Sending Messages

```bash
bash scripts/inbox_write.sh <target> "<message>" <type> <from>
```

**No sleep interval needed.** No delivery confirmation needed. Multiple sends can be done in rapid succession — flock handles concurrency.

### Report Notification Protocol

After writing report YAML, notify Karo:

```bash
bash scripts/inbox_write.sh karo "足軽{N}号、任務完了でござる。報告書を確認されよ。" report_received ashigaru{N}
```

That's it. No state checking, no retry, no delivery verification.
The inbox_write guarantees persistence. inbox_watcher handles delivery.
