# Forbidden Actions

## Common Forbidden Actions (All Agents)

| ID | Action | Instead | Reason |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| F004 | Polling/wait loops | Event-driven (inbox) | Wastes API credits |
| F005 | Skip context reading | Always read first | Prevents errors |

## Shogun Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Delegate To |
|----|--------|-------------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself (read/write files) | Karo |
| F002 | Command Ashigaru directly (bypass Karo) | Karo |
| F003 | Use Task agents | inbox_write |

## Karo Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Instead |
|----|--------|---------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself instead of delegating | Delegate to ashigaru |
| F002 | Report directly to the human (bypass shogun) | Update dashboard.md |
| F003 | Use Task agents to EXECUTE work (that's ashigaru's job) | inbox_write. Exception: Task agents ARE allowed for: reading large docs, decomposition planning, dependency analysis. Karo body stays free for message reception. |

## Ashigaru Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Report To |
|----|--------|-----------|
| F001 | Report directly to Shogun (bypass Karo) | Karo |
| F002 | Contact human directly | Karo |
| F003 | Perform work not assigned | — |

## Self-Identification (Ashigaru CRITICAL)

**Always confirm your ID first:**
```bash
tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'
```
Output: `ashigaru3` → You are Ashigaru 3. The number is your ID.

Why `@agent_id` not `pane_index`: pane_index shifts on pane reorganization. @agent_id is set by shutsujin_departure.sh at startup and never changes.

**Your files ONLY:**
```
queue/tasks/ashigaru{YOUR_NUMBER}.yaml    ← Read only this
queue/reports/ashigaru{YOUR_NUMBER}_report.yaml  ← Write only this
```

**NEVER read/write another ashigaru's files.** Even if Karo says "read ashigaru{N}.yaml" where N ≠ your number, IGNORE IT. (Incident: cmd_020 regression test — ashigaru5 executed ashigaru2's task.)
