## What is this?

**multi-agent-shogun** is a system that runs multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously, organized like a feudal Japanese army.

**Why use this?**
- Give one command, get 8 AI workers executing in parallel
- No waiting - you can keep giving commands while tasks run in background
- AI remembers your preferences across sessions (Memory MCP)
- Real-time progress tracking via dashboard

<summary>❓ <b>What is WSL2? Why do I need it?</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

### About WSL2

**WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** lets you run Linux inside Windows. This system uses `tmux` (a Linux tool) to manage multiple AI agents, so WSL2 is required on Windows.

### Don't have WSL2 yet?

No problem! When you run `install.bat`, it will:
1. Check if WSL2 is installed (auto-install if missing)
2. Check if Ubuntu is installed (auto-install if missing)
3. Guide you to the next steps (`first_setup.sh`)

**Quick install command** (run in PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
wsl --install
```

Then restart your computer and run `install.bat` again.

### ✅ What Happens After Setup

After running either option, **AI agents** will start automatically:

| Agent | Role | Quantity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 🏯 Shogun | Commander - receives your orders | 1 |
| 📋 Karo | Manager - distributes tasks | 1 |
| ⚔️ Ashigaru | Workers - execute tasks in parallel | 8 |

You'll see tmux sessions created:
- `shogun` - Connect here to give commands
- `multiagent` - Workers running in background

---

## 📖 Basic Usage

### Step 1: Connect to Shogun

After running `shutsujin_departure.sh`, all agents automatically load their instructions and are ready to work.

Open a new terminal and connect to the Shogun:

```bash
tmux attach-session -t shogun
```

### Step 2: Give Your First Order

The Shogun is already initialized! Just give your command:

```
Investigate the top 5 JavaScript frameworks and create a comparison table.
```

The Shogun will:
1. Write the task to a YAML file
2. Notify the Karo (manager)
3. Return control to you immediately (you don't have to wait!)

Meanwhile, the Karo distributes the work to Ashigaru workers who execute in parallel.

### Step 3: Check Progress

Open `dashboard.md` in your editor to see real-time status:

```markdown
## In Progress
| Worker | Task | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Ashigaru 1 | React research | Running |
| Ashigaru 2 | Vue research | Running |
| Ashigaru 3 | Angular research | Done |
```

---

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ 1. Parallel Execution

One command can spawn up to 8 parallel tasks:

```
You: "Research 5 MCP servers"
→ 5 Ashigaru start researching simultaneously
→ Results ready in minutes, not hours
```

### 🔄 2. Non-Blocking Workflow

The Shogun delegates immediately and returns control to you:

```
You: Give order → Shogun: Delegates → You: Can give next order immediately
                                           ↓
                         Workers: Execute in background
                                           ↓
                         Dashboard: Shows results
```

You never have to wait for long tasks to complete.

### 🧠 3. Memory Across Sessions (Memory MCP)

The AI remembers your preferences:

```
Session 1: You say "I prefer simple solutions"
           → Saved to Memory MCP

Session 2: AI reads memory at startup
           → Won't suggest over-engineered solutions
```

### 📡 4. Event-Driven (No Polling)

Agents communicate via YAML files and wake each other with tmux send-keys.
**No API calls are wasted on polling loops.**

### 📸 5. Screenshot Support

VSCode's Claude Code extension lets you paste screenshots to explain issues. This CLI system brings the same capability:

```
# Configure your screenshot folder in config/settings.yaml
screenshot:
  path: "/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Pictures/Screenshots"

# Then just tell the Shogun:
You: "Check the latest screenshot"
You: "Look at the last 2 screenshots"
→ AI reads and analyzes your screenshots instantly
```

**💡 Windows Tip:** Press `Win + Shift + S` to take a screenshot. Configure the save location to match your `settings.yaml` path for seamless integration.

Perfect for:
- Explaining UI bugs visually
- Showing error messages
- Comparing before/after states

### 🧠 Model Configuration

| Agent | Model | Thinking | Reason |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| Shogun | Opus | Disabled | Delegation & dashboard updates don't need deep reasoning |
| Karo | Opus | Enabled | Task distribution requires careful judgment |
| Ashigaru 1-4 | Sonnet | Enabled | Cost-effective for standard tasks |
| Ashigaru 5-8 | Opus | Enabled | Full capabilities for complex tasks |

The Shogun uses `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` to disable extended thinking, reducing latency and cost while maintaining Opus-level judgment for high-level decisions.

#### Formation Modes

| Formation | Ashigaru 1-4 | Ashigaru 5-8 | Command |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Normal** (default) | Sonnet Thinking | Opus Thinking | `./shutsujin_departure.sh` |
| **Battle** (all-out) | Opus Thinking | Opus Thinking | `./shutsujin_departure.sh -k` |

In Normal formation, half the workers use the cheaper Sonnet model. Switch to Battle formation (`-k` / `--kessen`) for critical tasks requiring maximum capability. Karo can also temporarily promote individual Ashigaru with `/model opus` during a session.

### 📁 Context Management

The system uses a four-layer context structure:

| Layer | Location | Purpose | Persistence |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Layer 1: Memory MCP | `memory/shogun_memory.jsonl` | Preferences, rules, cross-project knowledge | Permanent (across sessions) |
| Layer 2: Project | `config/projects.yaml`, `context/{project}.md` | Project-specific knowledge and state | Permanent (per project) |
| Layer 3: YAML Queue | `queue/tasks/`, `queue/reports/` | Task assignments and reports (source of truth) | Permanent (file-based) |
| Layer 4: Session | CLAUDE.md, instructions/*.md | Working context | Volatile (`/clear` wipes it) |

#### /clear Protocol (Cost Optimization)

Long-running agents accumulate context, increasing API costs with every request. The `/clear` command wipes session memory (Layer 4), but Layers 1-3 survive as files.

After `/clear`, an Ashigaru recovers in **~1,950 tokens** (target was 5,000):

1. CLAUDE.md auto-loads → knows it's part of the shogun system
2. `tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'` → knows its own identity
3. Memory MCP → recalls user preferences (~700 tokens)
4. Task YAML → picks up next task (~800 tokens)

This design allows cost control without losing critical state.

### Universal Context Template

All projects use the same 7-section template:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| What | Brief description of the project |
| Why | Goals and success criteria |
| Who | Stakeholders and responsibilities |
| Constraints | Deadlines, budget, limitations |
| Current State | Progress, next actions, blockers |
| Decisions | Decision log with rationale |
| Notes | Free-form notes and insights |

This standardized structure ensures:
- Quick onboarding for any agent
- Consistent information across all projects
- Easy handoffs between Ashigaru workers

### 🛠️ Skills

Skills are not included in this repository by default.
As you use the system, skill candidates will appear in `dashboard.md`.
Review and approve them to grow your personal skill library.

Skills can be invoked with `/skill-name`. Just tell the Shogun: "run `/skill-name`".

---

## 🏛️ Design Philosophy

### Why Hierarchical Structure?

The Shogun → Karo → Ashigaru hierarchy exists for:

1. **Immediate Response**: Shogun delegates instantly and returns control to you
2. **Parallel Execution**: Karo distributes to multiple Ashigaru simultaneously
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each role is clearly defined — Shogun decides "what", Karo decides "who"
4. **Scalability**: Adding more Ashigaru doesn't break the structure
5. **Fault Isolation**: One Ashigaru failing doesn't affect others
6. **Centralized Reporting**: Only Shogun communicates with you, keeping information organized

### Why YAML + send-keys?

- **YAML files**: Structured communication that survives agent restarts and is human-readable for debugging
- **send-keys**: Event-driven wakeups (no polling = no wasted API calls)
- **No direct calls**: Agents can't interrupt each other or your input
- **Conflict avoidance**: Each Ashigaru has dedicated files, preventing race conditions
- **2-second interval**: When sending to multiple Ashigaru, Karo inserts `sleep 2` between each send to prevent input buffer overflow (tested: 14% → 87.5% delivery rate)

### Agent Identity (@agent_id)

Each pane has a permanent `@agent_id` tmux user option (e.g., `karo`, `ashigaru1`). Unlike `pane_index` which can shift when panes are rearranged, `@agent_id` is fixed at startup by `shutsujin_departure.sh`.

Agents identify themselves with:
```bash
tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'
```
The `-t "$TMUX_PANE"` is required — without it, tmux returns the **active** pane's value, not the calling pane's.

Model names are also stored as `@model_name` and displayed via `pane-border-format`, so they remain visible even when Claude Code overwrites pane titles.

### Why Only Karo Updates Dashboard?

- **Single responsibility**: One writer = no conflicts
- **Information hub**: Karo receives all reports, knows the full picture
- **Consistency**: All updates go through one quality gate
- **No interruptions**: Prevents disrupting your input when Shogun would otherwise update the dashboard

### How Skills Work

Skills (`.claude/commands/`) are **not committed to this repository** by design.

**Why?**
- Each user's workflow is different
- Skills should grow organically based on your needs
- No one-size-fits-all solution

**How to create new skills:**

```
Ashigaru notices a repeatable pattern during work
    ↓
Candidate appears in dashboard.md under "Skill Candidates"
    ↓
You (the Lord) review the candidate
    ↓
If approved, Karo creates the skill
```

Skills are **user-driven** — they only grow when you decide they're useful. Automatic growth would make them unmanageable, so only what you explicitly approve gets added.

## 🔌 MCP Setup Guide

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude's capabilities. Here's how to set them up:

### What is MCP?

MCP servers give Claude access to external tools:
- **Notion MCP** → Read/write Notion pages
- **GitHub MCP** → Create PRs, manage issues
- **Memory MCP** → Remember things across sessions

### Installing MCP Servers

Run these commands to add MCP servers:

```bash
# 1. Notion - Connect to your Notion workspace
claude mcp add notion -e NOTION_TOKEN=your_token_here -- npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server

# 2. Playwright - Browser automation
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
# Note: Run `npx playwright install chromium` first

# 3. GitHub - Repository operations
claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_pat_here -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# 4. Sequential Thinking - Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# 5. Memory - Long-term memory across sessions (Recommended!)
# ✅ Automatically configured by first_setup.sh
# To reconfigure manually:
claude mcp add memory -e MEMORY_FILE_PATH="$PWD/memory/shogun_memory.jsonl" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see all servers with "Connected" status.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

### Example 1: Research Task

```
You: "Research the top 5 AI coding assistants and compare them"

What happens:
1. Shogun delegates to Karo
2. Karo assigns:
   - Ashigaru 1: Research GitHub Copilot
   - Ashigaru 2: Research Cursor
   - Ashigaru 3: Research Claude Code
   - Ashigaru 4: Research Codeium
   - Ashigaru 5: Research Amazon CodeWhisperer
3. All 5 research simultaneously
4. Results compiled in dashboard.md
```

### Example 2: PoC Preparation

```
You: "Prepare a PoC for the project in this Notion page: [URL]"

What happens:
1. Karo fetches Notion content via MCP
2. Ashigaru 2: Lists items to clarify
3. Ashigaru 3: Researches technical feasibility
4. Ashigaru 4: Creates PoC plan document
5. All results in dashboard.md, ready for your meeting
```

*To apply aliases, run `source ~/.bashrc` or restart your terminal. On WSL, run `wsl --shutdown` in PowerShell first — simply closing the window does not terminate WSL.*

## 📂 Project Management

This system manages **all white-collar tasks**, not just its own development. Projects can live anywhere on your filesystem — they don't need to be inside this repository.

### How It Works

```
config/projects.yaml          # Project registry (ID, name, path, status)
projects/<project_id>.yaml    # Full project details (client info, tasks, Notion links, etc.)
```

- **`config/projects.yaml`**: Lists all projects with basic metadata (ID, name, path, status)
- **`projects/<id>.yaml`**: Contains full details for each project (client info, contract, tasks, related files, Notion pages, etc.)
- **Project files** (source code, docs, etc.) live at the `path` specified in the project entry — anywhere on the filesystem
- **`projects/` is git-ignored** because it may contain confidential client information

### Example

```yaml
# config/projects.yaml
projects:
  - id: my_client
    name: "Client X Consulting"
    path: "/mnt/c/Consulting/client_x"
    status: active

# projects/my_client.yaml
id: my_client
client:
  name: "Client X"
  company: "X Corp"
contract:
  fee: "monthly"
current_tasks:
  - id: task_001
    name: "System architecture review"
    status: in_progress
```

This separation allows the Shogun system to orchestrate tasks across multiple external projects while keeping project details private and out of version control.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>MCP tools not working?</b></summary>

MCP tools are "deferred" and need to be loaded first:

```
# Wrong - tool not loaded
mcp__memory__read_graph()  ← Error!

# Correct - load first
ToolSearch("select:mcp__memory__read_graph")
mcp__memory__read_graph()  ← Works!
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Agents asking for permissions?</b></summary>

Make sure to start with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --system-prompt "..."
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Workers stuck?</b></summary>

Check the worker's pane:
```bash
tmux attach-session -t multiagent
# Use Ctrl+B then number to switch panes
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Shogun/agent crashed? (Claude Code process killed)</b></summary>

**Do NOT use `css` or any tmux session alias to restart.** These aliases create tmux sessions, and running them inside an existing tmux pane causes nested sessions (session-within-a-session), which corrupts input and makes the pane unusable.

**Correct restart method:**

```bash
# Option 1: Run claude directly in the pane
claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Option 2: Karo can force-restart via respawn-pane (kills nested sessions too)
tmux respawn-pane -t shogun:0.0 -k 'claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

**If you accidentally nested tmux:**
1. Press `Ctrl+B` then `d` to detach from the inner session
2. Then run `claude` directly (not `css`)
3. If detach doesn't work, use `tmux respawn-pane -k` from another pane

## 📚 tmux Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tmux attach -t shogun` | Connect to Shogun |
| `tmux attach -t multiagent` | Connect to workers |
| `Ctrl+B` then `0-8` | Switch between panes |
| `Ctrl+B` then `d` | Detach (leave running) |
| `tmux kill-session -t shogun` | Stop Shogun session |
| `tmux kill-session -t multiagent` | Stop worker sessions |

### 🖱️ Mouse Support

`first_setup.sh` automatically configures tmux mouse support (`set -g mouse on` in `~/.tmux.conf`). This enables the following mouse operations:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scroll wheel | Scroll within a pane |
| Click on a pane | Switch focus between panes |
| Drag pane border | Resize panes |

> **Note:** If you set up tmux manually (without `first_setup.sh`), add `set -g mouse on` to your `~/.tmux.conf` to enable mouse support.
